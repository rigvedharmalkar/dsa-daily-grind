# DSA Daily Grind

Two brave fools solving Data Structures and Algorithms daily-ish.

## Contributors
- `rigvedharmalkar`: might actually be trying
- `ishaanbarde`: probably forgot this repo exists

## Folder Structure
Each person has their own folder. Inside are topic-based folders. Problems go in there. Keep a `notes.md` or `README.md` per folder if you want.

## Goal
Solve at least 1 DSA problem per day. Miss a day? That’s okay. Lie about it in your commits. That’s what GitHub is for.

## Optional Rules
- Add problem links + solution
- Commit message: `Add [topic] - [problem name]`
- Encourage. Don't mock. Unless you deserve it.
